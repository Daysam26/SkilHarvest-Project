### Project Overview
---
This Data Analysis aims to summarize the revenue generated from a SkilHarvest sale inventory over a period of 2 years in some particular region. By analyzing the trend in parameters in the data gathered. We seek to categorize the sales under certain conditions such as LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH and to make a tenable insight and understanding of the sales performance.

### Data Sources 
---
The primary source of data used is from SkilHarvest Sale Inventory.

### Tools Used
---
- Ms Excel [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
  - Data loading and Preparation
  - Pivoting
  - Data Visualisation
 
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
At first stage of data cleaning and preparation, the following were perform;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Import into missing column such as LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH categories of Unit Sold.
3. Summarization of all Data into Pivot Table; This includes,
   - Creating table ranges in a pivot table
   - Total region by their revenue
   - Sum total of units sold product by region
   - Total revenue generated by line of business 
   - Total revenue generated by month
    
### Exploratory Data Analysis 
---
The EDA involves in these Data Analysis are;
- Categorizing the unit sold into LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH by using IF/IFS function
- Top 5 market by revenue    
- Top 10 Store by Revenue
- Total region by revenue
- Bottom 5 stores by unit sold
- Report of revenue by month
- Basic Visualization
  
### Inference/Insight
![Total revenue by region](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34249ea1-ddda-4543-b6ac-1e6a8623b49e)
- TOTAL REVENUE WITHIN A REGION; This shows the total revenue of each region and successful compression of 30,800 data into six region. It obvious from the analysis that sales of service is tremendously increasing in North East follow by South West. Unlike North Central which have a low turnout in term of revenue output.

![Sum revenue by line of business](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4804eacf-3bed-4fc9-9ebc-aceab0718090)
- TOTAL REVENUE INLINE WITH BUSINESSES; More attention need to be focus at the rate which service plan are been demanded for. The percentage has been increasing over time with 71.02% in total revenue and sale of printer need no much attention with low total revenue of 8.29%.
  
![Ave  unit sold by line of bis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d4d79d8-a177-463c-873a-3110f16b5923)
- AVERAGE OF UNIT SOLD BY LINE OF BUSINESS; This analysis shows the descending order of average unit sold in line of business over a period of 2 years. Where parts and service plan are on lead role.

![Sum unit sold by market](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd085478-b6bf-49ac-9c2b-6da89a17a36c)
- SUM OF UNIT SOLD BY MARKET; The unit sold by state store has been a successful and progress one. State like EKITI, ABIA AND OYO are all doing great without any setback.

![Sum revenue by market](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb7fabfa-b036-4972-8538-05f2e5f56049)
- SUM OF REVENUE IN SOME MARKET; Here are first five (5) Market that maintain a progressive trend in revenue generated over time. State such as EKITI, ABIA,BAYELSA etc.

![Total revenue by store](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/019cdba7-61b9-4e0d-8079-4fe35d42b759)
- TOTAL REVENUE IN SOME STATE STORES; These are top Ten(10) Stores from these area of state need to be more targeted because the rate at which revenue is generated is on high demand.

![Sum unit sold by store](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4519948-b887-4d99-b1ee-d977a562c455)
- SUM OF UNIT SOLD IN SOME STATE STORE; These are top Ten (10) stores that perform excellently well which helps to understand which stores are under or over-performing against their target.

![Total revenue by month](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/962d0a30-aa9f-48c7-895e-907d30c210d6)
- TOTAL REVENUE (%) BY MONTH; The increase in percentage of revenue generated in 1st half (JAN. -JUNE) of the year shows the peak sales period. Customers demand more services during those period compare to 2nd half (JULY -DECEMBER) of the year and more attention need to be focus.

![Sum of unit sold by month](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42dbab58-8477-4c22-ac47-311ee76b18f6)
- SUM OF UNIT SOLD BY YEAR; An increase in revenue generated in 1st half of the year will definitely increase unit sold in that same period of time.

![Total revenue by year](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13004063-b87b-4ee9-b3e0-17e08fcd15bd)
- TOTAL REVENUE % BY YEAR; It is observe from the analysis that percentage of revenue generated in 2015 is extremely LOW compare to 2014 on ratio 3:6 and then might attributed to lot of challenges.

- SUM OF UNIT SOLD BY YEAR; Also a decrease in revenue of a year will definitely affect unit sold. Which made the unit sold in 2015 to be on LOW TURN OUT.

![Total unit sold by top 5model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24639743-a107-49bf-b736-db549aaf97a1)
- TOTAL UNIT SOLD OF TOP 5 MODELS; The visual shows the unit sold of top five (5) models that are trending within the market space.

![Average some revenue by 5top model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/948fe189-0bf0-43bb-a9d5-f6dfd90bb1dc)
- AVERAGE SOME OF REVENUE OF TOP 5 MODELS;  Here are top five (5) models that attract massive output in term of revenue over a period of 2 years.

### Recommendation
During the analysis, the following actions are recommended;

1. More focus need to be shifted to areas such as;
 - Regions (South East,North west, North central)
 - Line of Business (Pinter, copier and parts sales)
   
2. Investment and Promotion of manpower, various market strategies during off peak period, 2nd half (July- December) of the year to enhance output.
